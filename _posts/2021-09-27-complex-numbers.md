**Definition.** A *complex number* is an expression of the form $$a + bi$$, where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are real numbers. Two complex numbers $$a+bi$$ and $$c + di$$ are said to be equal ($$a + bi = c + di$$) if and only if $$a = c$$ and $$b = d$$.

## Imaginary Number $$i$$

The imaginary number $$i$$ is $$\sqrt{-1}$$. So, $$i^2 = -1$$.

## Complex Number Operations

Addition and subtraction of complex numbers:

$$(a + bi) \pm (c + di) \coloneqq (a \pm c) + (b \pm d)i$$

Multiplication of two complex numbers:

$$(a+ bi)(c + di) \coloneqq (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)i$$

Division of complex numbers:

$$\dfrac{a+bi}{c+di} = \dfrac{a+bi}{c+di} \dfrac{c-di}{c-di} = \dfrac{ac+bd}{c^2 + d^2} + \dfrac{bc - ad}{c^2 + d^2}i$$

## Complex Number Parts

**Definition.** The *real part* of the complex number $$a + bi$$ is the (real) number $$a$$; its *imaginary part* is the (real) number $$b$$. If $$a$$ is zero, the number is said to be a *pure imaginary number*.

## Complex Number Denotation

The letter $$z$$ is used to denote a complex number $$a + bi$$. The real part $$a$$ of a complex number is denoted $$\mathrm{Re}(z)$$. The imaginary part $$b$$ of a complex number is denoted $$\mathrm{Im}(z)$$. So,

$$z = a + bi = \mathrm{Re}(z) + i\mathrm{Im}(z)$$

The set of all complex numbers is denoted $$\Complex$$.
