title: "Something"

"Just write _something_.", I tell myself. What that something is I have no idea. But I am writing, and that's all that matters.

How about math? I've always wanted to write about math in a way for me to both teach and learn. The teaching part is easy, I think. The learning part is somewhat more difficult. The learning part ultimately becomes solidified notes. And am I actually learning as I write? No. The focus should be on how I write. I'm not writing a textbook. I'm not regurgitating facts. I'm writing about my own understanding and exploration. I'm writing about how math relates to me.
